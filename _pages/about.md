I'm Mahdi Erfanian, second year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Chicago, where I am a member of the [IndexLab](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~indexlab/) under the supervision of [Dr. Abolfazl Asudeh](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~asudeh/). I got my B.Sc in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology. My research spans **Multi-modal Data Management**, **Algorithmic Fairness**, and **Foundation Models**.
I am particularly interested in employing foundation models, including large language models, to address different challenges in data managementâ€”such as mitigating bias in training data and enhancing multi-modal data retrieval through synthetic data generation. Additionally, I am passionate about **Algorithm Design**, with a focus on optimizing both fairness and efficiency in data-driven systems.
