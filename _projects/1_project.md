**Needle** is an efficient and powerful text-to-image retrieval framework that significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in multimodal information retrieval. This project represents a breakthrough in combining generative AI with database systems to solve complex natural language queries.

## Key Achievements

- **200% improvement** over OpenAI's CLIP in mean average precision on complex natural language queries
- Advanced multimodal data management capabilities
- Integration of foundation models for enhanced retrieval performance

## Technical Innovation

The system leverages cutting-edge generative AI techniques to bridge the gap between natural language queries and visual content, enabling more intuitive and accurate information retrieval across multimodal datasets.

## Impact

This work has been submitted to **ICLR 2025** and represents a significant advancement in the field of multimodal data management and information retrieval systems.
